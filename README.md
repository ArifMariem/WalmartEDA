Current Work:

Univariate Analysis:

Cleaned and preprocessed Walmart sales data.
* Implemented forecasting models like ARIMA to analyse sales trends over time (e.g., monthly, weekly).
* Performed time series decomposition.
* Understand each variable's distribution, outliers,...
* Fit variables to a model and evaluate performance using metrics.


Multivariate Analysis:
* Analyze relationships between Weekly sales and other relevant variables (e.g., Temperature, date , Fuel price, CPI,..).
* Utilize techniques like correlation analysis, regression analysis...
Benefits:

* Gain deeper insights into sales patterns.
* Identify factors influencing sales and develop targeted strategies.
* Enhance decision-making for product placement, pricing, and promotions.
