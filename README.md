Current Work:

Univariate Analysis:

Cleaned and preprocessed Walmart sales data.
* Analyzed sales trends over time (e.g., monthly, weekly).
* Identified top-selling products and categories.
* Performed time series decomposition.

Future Work:
* Implemented forecasting models like ARIMA, SARIMA.
* Evaluated model performance using metrics like RMSE or MAPE.


Multivariate Analysis:
* Analyze relationships between sales and other relevant variables (e.g., price, promotions, weather).
* Utilize techniques like correlation analysis, regression analysis, or machine learning models.
Benefits:

* Gain deeper insights into sales patterns and predict future trends.
* Identify factors influencing sales and develop targeted strategies.
* Enhance decision-making for product placement, pricing, and promotions.
